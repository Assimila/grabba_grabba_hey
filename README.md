A tool for downloading EO data from archives. Initially, it will support the Sentinel data hub,
but probably also MODIS and if I can get it to work, the USGS Landsat archive. The aim here is
to have a simple tool that can use a configuration file to download data from the archive
unattended (or attended if you have the patience).

I hope to have a simple database of acquired data, so that the program can be run as a cronjob.

Still early days, expect disruption...
